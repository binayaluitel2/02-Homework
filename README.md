Responsive Portfolio for Binaya Luitel.

## Description:
As a part of this assignment, I attempted to create a responsive portfolio which graciously expands/contracts when browser width is changed between different devices such as desktop, table, mobile, etc. We also learned bootstrap and grid system which is integral part of web development.

## Credits:

Kudos to Jason McGinthy, Emily Todt and Shauna Dunn. We worked together a team. So, there might be code matches between us.
